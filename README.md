DijkstraThreeWays
=================

Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm implemented in Ruby, Lisp, and Processing. Handy for folks just starting out with any of those languages, I assume. The repository is broken into three separate folders Ruby, Lisp, and Processing. Instructions for how
to run each program are included below.

Lisp
----
Contains several test cases for consideration. As well as sample output (graph-output-start-1).
This implementation removes previously visited nodes from the search space to provide
a performance gain. Input files are formatted with the first number representing the size of the graph.
The following triples represent econnections and the edge weight of the connection.

dijkstra is the main entry point to the application. Type (dijkstra) at the Lisp command 
prompt to run the program.

Ruby
----
A readme contained in the Ruby folder describes one approach to using Ruby for the absolute beginner.
It assumes you do not have Ruby installed on your machine. Suffice to say, running the main.rb file will
execute the application. If you need more thorough instruction, consult the included readme.

Processing
----------
